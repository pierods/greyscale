This gnome shell extension makes a Wayland session greyscale. It is inspired by the 
"tint-all" extension which does not work anymore on gnome 4. 


The purpose of this extension is to have the smallest possible extension that provides needed
functionality to gnome, so that it can be easily ported as gnome evolves.
